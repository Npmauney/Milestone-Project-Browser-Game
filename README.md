WELCOME TO JACK BLACK'S BLACK JACK!

//Introduction
Blackjack is a timeless classic card game and seemed a fitting challenge for my first attempt at a browser game. I have included Jack Black as the game's mascot for the obvious reason of the name and because Jack Black is simply awesome! 

//Rules and Controls
The goal of Blackjack is to achieve 21 without going over or under. You begin the game by placing your bet in the input field and hitting submit! You must enter a whole integer equal to or less than the current amount of money in your holdings and it must be greater than 0. Next you will hit if you would like to draw a card and stay when you are ready to end the hand to see the results. You can then hit play again to start a new hand. However, if the last hand resulted in 0 dollars remaining in your balance, you will be alerted that Jack Black has won the game! The game will automatically reset your winnings back to the default of $100. Note that while this program closely follows the standard rules of BlackJack, it has been simplified and omits more complicated functions such as split, double down, surrender, etc. 

//Technologies used and Functionality
This game was built with the help of Chat GPT. Questions were posed on how to achieve specific functions and how to fix issues that arose over time. Although most bugs have been worked out, the one I am still aware of at this time is the player being allowed to bet a number with a decimal (ex 1.5). The parseInt rounds this to the nearest number.
